  If you want to use the default controller, you will need to set `legacy: false` in the Zigbee2MQTT configuration.

E1810: |
  This device mapping has also support for E1524 controller.

E2002: |
  This device mapping has also support for E2001 controller.

  In case of working with <strong>z2m</strong> the device needs to be flagged as `legacy: false` as
  <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/324131092621.html#options">Zigbee2MQTT
  documentation recommends</a>.

  In case of working with <strong>z2m</strong> and wanting to use the multiclick functionality, then
  you need to make sure to remove from the device specific (devices.yaml) the
  `multiple_press_timeout` option.

  In case of <strong>deCONZ</strong>, all the click actions are mapped with X002 actions, so when the
  button is released after being clicked.

  For the State integration, it requires the <a href="https://github.com/upsert/lutron-caseta-pro">LutronCasetaPro</a>
  CUSTOM integration by upsert. THIS WILL NOT WORK with the default Lutron Caseta integration.
  All Lutron Caseta Pro Pico remotes supported by LutronCasetaPro are supported using this
  controller type except for the 4-button PJ2-4B remotes which is separate.

  This controller does not have a self-explained way to use it since its main
  purpose is to be customized, this is why we recommend to customize it with
  <a href="/controllerx/advanced/custom-controllers">custom mapping</a>.

  deCONZ integration should be added with <a href="/controllerx/others/integrations#deconz">type gesture</a>.

MLI404011: |
  Some buttons are left to be mapped for both integrations.
  Please read more about in <a href="https://github.com/xaviml/controllerx/issues/111">here (deconz)</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/xaviml/controllerx/issues/176">here (z2m)</a>.

OsramAC025XX00NJ: |
  This controller is supported for AC0251100NJ / AC0251400NJ / AC0251600NJ / AC0251700NJ.
  Different models are just different colours.

Philips929003017102: |
  This controller has 4 modes and depending on which one is used,
  it will trigger one action or another: single_rocker, single_push_button, dual_rocker, dual_push_button.

  Note that each button perform the same actions.
  This is because ControllerX is designed to control just one entity (light or media player).
  So, you can include the `actions` parameter to include the actions needed,
  or use the `mapping` attribute to define a <a href="/controllerx/advanced/custom-controllers">custom mapping</a>.
  You can check <a href="https://github.com/xaviml/controllerx/issues/18#issuecomment-582535634">here</a> for reference.

  This controller is a white-label version of the Sunricher SR-ZG9001K8-DIM.

  Also, this controller support hold action, but not release. This means that there is not
  smooth brightness changes when holding, just step by step everytime is held.

W2049: |
  This controller fires "on" action when arrows are held as well as the hold arrow action.
  So this means that when long pressing the arrows, the light(s) will turn on before changing the color.

WXKG01LM: |
  The ZHA implementation of this button does not yet support hold and release actions.
