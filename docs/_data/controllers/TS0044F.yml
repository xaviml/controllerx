note: >-
  This device is very similar to the TS0044 Tuya, except that it doesn't hold action, double clicks.
  Note that each button perform the same actions.
  This is because ControllerX is design to control just one entity (light or media player).
  So you can include the `actions` parameter to include the actions needed,
  or use the `mapping` attribute to define a <a href="/controllerx/advanced/custom-controllers">custom mapping</a>.
  You can check <a href="https://github.com/xaviml/controllerx/issues/18#issuecomment-582535634">here</a> for reference.
  Also, this controller doesn't support hold action. This means that there is not
  smooth brightness changes when holding, just step by step everytime it's pressed.
