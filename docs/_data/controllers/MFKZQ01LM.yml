note: >-
  This controller does not have a self-explained way to use it since its main
  purpose is to be customized, this is why we recommend to customize it with
  <a href="/controllerx/advanced/custom-controllers">custom mapping</a>.
  deCONZ integration should be added with <a href="/controllerx/others/integrations#deconz">type gesture</a>.
