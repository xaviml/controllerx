note: >-
  This controller does not have a self-explained way to use it since its main 
  purpose is to customize it, this is why we recommend to customize it with 
  <a href="/controllerx/others/custom-controllers">Custom controllers</a>. 
  deCONZ integration should be added with <a href="/controllerx/others/integrations">type gesture</a>.
