note: >-
  Note that all actions related to both, left and right, do the same. 
  This is because ControllerX is design to control just one entity (light or media player).
  So you can include the `actions` parameter to include the actions needed.
  You can check <a href="https://github.com/xaviml/controllerx/issues/18#issuecomment-582535634">here</a> for reference.
  Also, this controller support hold action, but not release. This means that there is not 
  smooth brightness changes when holding, just step by step everytime is held.
