However, there is a downside about removing this dependency and it is that not only the proprietary hubs let you integrate a controller with lights or media players, but it also gives a behaviour to them. This is why we end up using Home Assistant automations, however when it comes to create complex automations like this kind, it gets tricky and difficult to maintain. This is where ControllerX comes in together with AppDaemon, to give the behaviour to the devices we lose when not having the original hub as well as easily create automation focus on button events.</p>"},{"location":"#quick-example","title":"Quick example","text":"<p>With just this configuration placed in <code>/homeassistant/appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml</code>, you can have the E2002 controller from IKEA (4 buttons) connected to the livingroom light and be able to change the brightness and color temperature or color.</p> <pre><code>livingroom_controller:\n  module: controllerx\n  class: E2002LightController\n  controller: livingroom_controller\n  integration:\n    name: z2m\n    listen_to: mqtt\n  light: light.livingroom\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#videos-examples","title":"Videos examples","text":"<ul> <li>E1810 (IKEA) controlling a light through MQTT</li> <li>Symfonisk controlling Chromecast volume</li> <li>Magic Xiaomi Cube controlling a colour light</li> <li>E1810 (IKEA) controlling a colour light with ZHA</li> <li>Symfonisk controlling Google Home mini</li> <li>Symfonisk controlling a light</li> <li>Showing the colour wheel from HA</li> <li>E1743 (IKEA) button as a cover controller</li> <li>E1810 (IKEA) as a TV remote</li> <li>Double click for the middle button for E1810 (IKEA)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#community","title":"Community","text":"<p>Thank you to all these people for putting out there content related to ControllerX:</p> <ul> <li>/u/canaletto -

When holding or rotating the controller (especially the Symfonisk - E1744), it doesn't stop changing the brightness or volume","text":"<p>This is a known issue that cannot be fixed in the code. Controllers with holding-release functionality fire 2 events, one when the holding/rotation starts and another when it stops rotating or is released. What ControllerX does for you is send periodically requests to HA via call services to update your brightness, volume, etc.</p> <p>This is probably happenning to you sometimes and is because the stop/release action has not been fired. This can happen due to:</p> <ul> <li>A rotation is too fast and confusing to know if it stopped or not.</li> <li>The network is overloaded.</li> <li>The server cannot handle the requests on time.</li> <li>The controller and the light are far distanced from the coordinator.</li> </ul> <p>However, these are some actions you can take to overcome this problem and reduce the number of times that this happens:</p> <ul> <li>If <code>release</code> action is sent at a similar time than a <code>hold</code> one, you could use <code>release_delay</code> attribute to execute <code>release</code> actions some amount of time defined after they have been fired. For example: <code>release_delay: 0.01</code> (time in seconds).</li> <li>If using z2m, change the integration to listen MQTT directly, this way it will avoid the HA state machine layer. Read more about in here.</li> <li>If using deCONZ and you just want to dim your lights smoothly, then you can consider using this AppDaemon app from @Burningstone91. It brightens/dims your lights with a deCONZ calls instead of calling HA periodically, this means that deCONZ would handle the dimming for you.</li> <li>Play around with delay (default is 350ms) and automatic_steps (default is 10) attributes. You can read more about them in here. The lower the delay is, the more requests will go to HA. The more automatic_steps, the more steps it will take to get from min to max, and vice versa.</li> <li>Add more Zigbee routers to the network.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#8-symfonisk-controller-e1744-is-not-working-with-zigbee2mqtt-integration","title":"8.

Well, the default mapping for E1744 has the actions of the new implementation in Zigbee2MQTT for this controller.

If you have the Zigbee2MQTT addon, you will have a file in <code>/share/zigbee2mqtt/devices.yaml</code> with the device-specific configuration. You will need to add <code>legacy: false</code> to your E1744 controller as shown in the Zigbee2MQTT documentation. With this the problem will be solved once Zigbee2MQTT is restarted.

However, it became difficult to expand and add more functionality, so now the <code>click</code> and <code>hold</code> actions can be configured as follows:</p> <pre><code>example_app:\n  module: controllerx\n  class: E1810Controller\n  integration: deconz\n  controller: my_controller\n  light: light.my_light\n  merge_mapping:\n    2001:\n      action: click # [click, hold] This is the predefined action.\n      attribute: brightness # [brightness, color_temp, white_value, color, xy_color]\n      direction: up # [up, down, toggle (only for hold)]\n      mode: stop # [stop, loop, bounce (only for hold)] Stepper mode\n      steps: 10 # It overrides the `manual_steps` and `automatic_steps` global attributes\n</code></pre> <p>The fields are the following:</p> <ul> <li>action: This is the predefined action, which in this case is <code>click</code> or <code>hold</code>.</li> <li>attribute: Attribute we want to act on. The available values are: <code>brightness</code>, <code>color_temp</code>, <code>white_value</code>, <code>color</code>, and <code>xy_color</code>. However, <code>xy_color</code> will ignore the <code>mode</code> and <code>steps</code> attribute since it already loops through the color wheel.</li> <li>direction: Direction to start. Options are <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, and <code>toggle</code>. In case of <code>click</code> action, it will not accept <code>toggle</code>.</li> <li><code>up</code>: It goes up.</li> <li><code>down</code>: It goes down.</li> <li><code>toggle</code>: It changes direction everytime the action is performed.</li> <li>mode: This is the stepper mode. Options are <code>stop</code>, <code>loop</code>, and <code>bounce</code>. In case of <code>click</code> action, it will not accept <code>bounce</code>.</li> <li><code>stop</code>: This is the default behaviour. It stops when it reaches the ends (min or max).</li> <li><code>loop</code>: It loops through all the values under the same direction, so when reaching the end, it will start over. For example, if you configure the brightness with direction <code>up</code>, it will go from the value is currently in until 255 (default max), and then it will start over (1 default min) without releasing the button. This <code>mode</code> will not stop unless there is a <code>release</code> action or it reaches the <code>max_loops</code> attribute (default is 50 steps).</li> <li><code>bounce</code>: It bounces the ends, so when reaching the end it will switch directions. For example, if you configure the brightness with direction <code>down</code>, it will go from the value is currently in until 1 (default min), then it will start going up until reaching 255 and bouncing back again. This <code>mode</code> will not stop unless there is a <code>release</code> action or it reaches the <code>max_loops</code> attribute (default is 50 steps).</li> </ul> <p>As you can see, the configuration is much flexible, however, it adds more lines than using the direct predefined actions. For this reason, the predefined actions like <code>{hold,click}_{brightness,color_temp,white_color,...}_{up,down,toggle}</code> will not be removed, but ControllerX will not have more of these since now it can be configured differently. This means for example that this configuration:</p> <pre><code>example_app:\n  module: controllerx\n  class: E1810Controller\n  integration: deconz\n  controller: my_controller\n  light: light.my_light\n  merge_mapping:\n    2001:\n      action: hold\n      attribute: brightness\n      direction: up\n</code></pre> <p>It is the same as:</p> <pre><code>example_app:\n  module: controllerx\n  class: E1810Controller\n  integration: deconz\n  controller: my_controller\n  light: light.my_light\n  merge_mapping:\n    2001:\n      action: hold_brightness_up\n</code></pre> <p>The old predefined actions have <code>stop</code> as a default mode.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/multiple-clicks/","title":"Multiple clicks","text":"<p>This page assumes you already know how the <code>mapping</code> attribute works.</p> <p>Some controllers allow events like double, triple (even quadruple) clicks, but others only allow single clicks events coming from the controller. This feature, then, allows you to virtually manage multiple clicks, especially for those single click events.</p> <p>When adding a new custom mapping for your controller, you can use a new token (<code>$</code>) to indicate how many times an events needs to occur, so the action gets fired. Let's see an example:</p> <pre><code>example_app:\n  module: controllerx\n  class: E1810Controller\n  controller: my_controller\n  integration:\n    name: z2m\n    listen_to: mqtt\n  light: light.my_light\n  multiple_click_delay: 500 # default\n  mapping:\n    brightness_up_click: \"on\"\n    toggle: click_color_down\n    toggle$1: click_color_up\n    toggle$2: \"off\"\n</code></pre> <p>This could be a silly example, but it is enough to remark some points about this feature. In this configuration we see 2 actions: <code>brightness_up_click</code> (not \"multi-clickable\") and <code>toggle</code> (\"multi-clickable\"). We also see an attribute called <code>multiple_click_delay</code>, which indicates the delay (in milliseconds and 500 by default) when a multiple click action should be trigger. Let's go over the next scenarios:</p> <ul> <li><code>brightness_up_click</code> is clicked once: The <code>on</code> action will be triggered immidiately, with no delay.</li> <li><code>toggle</code> is clicked once: The <code>click_color_up</code> action will be triggered after 500ms. Also noticed that <code>toggle</code> and <code>toggle$1</code> are basically the same, so if both are present, the one with the token (<code>$</code>) will be the prevalent. So <code>click_color_down</code> will never be called.</li> <li><code>toggle</code> is clicked twice (with less than 500ms between clicks): The <code>off</code> action will be triggered in 500ms after the second click.</li> </ul> <p>This next example will show a real use of this feature with the E1810 controller from IKEA.</p> <pre><code>livingroom:\n  module: controllerx\n  class: E1810Controller\n  controller: livingroom_controller\n  integration:\n    name: z2m\n    listen_to: mqtt\n  light: light.livingroom_lamp\n  smooth_power_on: true\n  merge_mapping:\n    toggle$2:\n      service: light.toggle\n      data:\n        entity_id: light.livingroom_fairylights\n    toggle$3:\n      service: light.toggle\n      data:\n        entity_id: light.bedroom\n</code></pre> <p>This will keep the default mapping for the E1810 controller by using <code>merge_mapping</code> and add a new action when clicking 2 and 3 times the middle button to toggle the fairylights and the bedroom lamp.</p> <p>Note that ControllerX registers the multiple-click events in the initialization phase by checking the events with <code>$</code>, so it records whether it needs to wait to trigger the multiple-click event or not. If the triggered event is not registered as mutliple-clickable, then it will be triggered immidiately. However, if the triggered event is mutliple-clickable then it will wait as much time as specified in <code>multiple_click_delay</code> to detect if another click is issued or not. If not second (n-th click) is registered, then the event is triggered. Therefore, all multi-clickable events will have a delay specified by <code>multiple_click_delay</code>.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/predefined-actions/","title":"Predefined actions","text":"<p>This page assumes you already know how the <code>mapping</code> attribute works.</p> <p>Here you can find a list of predefined actions (one of the action types) for each type of controller.</p>"},{"location":"advanced/predefined-actions/#light","title":"Light","text":"<p>When using a light controller (e.g. <code>E1743Controller</code>) or <code>LightController</code>, the following actions can be used as a predefined action:</p> value description parameters <code>\"on\"</code> It turns on the light - <code>attributes</code>: a mapping with attribute and value <code>\"off\"</code> It turns off the light <code>toggle</code> It toggles the light - <code>attributes</code>: a mapping with attribute and value <code>toggle_full_brightness</code> It toggles the light, setting the brightness to the maximum value when turning on. <code>toggle_full_white_value</code> It toggles the light, setting the white value to the maximum value when turning on. <code>toggle_full_color_temp</code> It toggles the light, setting the color temperature to the maximum value when turning on. <code>toggle_min_brightness</code> It toggles the light, setting the brightness to the minimum value when turning on. <code>toggle_min_white_value</code> It toggles the light, setting the white value to the minimum value when turning on. <code>toggle_min_color_temp</code> It toggles the light, setting the color temperature to the minimum value when turning on. <code>release</code> It stops <code>hold</code> actions <code>on_full_brightness</code> It puts the brightness to the maximum value <code>on_full_white_value</code> It puts the white value to the maximum value <code>on_full_color_temp</code> It puts the color temp to the maximum value <code>on_min_brightness</code> It puts the brightness to the minimum value <code>on_min_white_value</code> It puts the white value to the minimum value <code>on_min_color_temp</code> It puts the color temp to the minimum value <code>on_min_max_brightness</code> It puts the brightness to the minimum value if the light is off or brightness different to minimum value; else it puts the brightness to the maximum value. <code>on_max_min_brightness</code> It puts the brightness to the maximum value if the light is off or brightness different to maximum value; else it puts the brightness to the minimum value. <code>on_min_max_color_temp</code> It puts the color temp to the minimum value if the light is off or color temp different to minimum value; else it puts the color temp to the maximum value. <code>on_max_min_color_temp</code> It puts the color temp to the maximum value if the light is off or color temp different to maximum value; else it puts the color temp to the minimum value. <code>set_half_brightness</code> It sets the brightness to 50% <code>set_half_white_value</code> It sets the white value to 50% <code>set_half_color_temp</code> It sets the color temp to 50% <code>sync</code> It syncs the light(s) to full brightness and white colour or 2700K (370 mireds) - <code>brightness</code>- <code>color_temp</code>- <code>xy_color</code> <code>click</code> It brights up/down accordingly with the <code>manual_steps</code> attribute, and allow to pass parameters through YAML config.

Hence the huge amount of sensors.</p> <p>If you're not using a movement sensor in your build, you could (but actually don't need to) revise YAML. If you experience issues with the 'floating' GPIO used for the PIR sensor, just pull pin D5 permanently low or high.</p> <p>Two entities needs to be entered. Your Sonos main speaker and optional temperature sensor. If temperature sensor is omitted, you can just revise YAML and delete page 3 &amp; 4 from the display lambda configuration. Also remember to revise <code>interval</code> page count from 4 to 2.</p> <p>Revise <code>sonos_status</code> and <code>outdoor_temp</code> sensors in YAML below, to match your HA entities for Sonos main speaker and outdoor temperature sensor. Create a new ESPHome node and configure it with your ESP8266 board settings and WiFi credentials. Edit node and copy/paste revised YAML below to your node. Remember to insert your node's autogenerated WiFi ap settings to YAML. Save it, upload and enjoy! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude0e</p> <p>One final note on current YAML configuration ESPHome is at max with all these included sensors, schedulers running and the quite extensive display lambda. Addding just one extra sensor to current YAML, will make ESPHome crash on boot.

With this setup, you'll be able to toggle, turn lights on at full brightness, sync and dim your lights directly from your wall switch. Today, many WIFI switches are so small, that they can fit behind wall outlets/switches or in ceiling outlets. Personally, I've used Shelly One devices and Itead Sonoff Mini's. Both are easy to flash with Tasmota using either USB-to-UART adapter or directly OTA. No soldering is actually needed these days.
